## Data Source and Project Ideas
1. [Temperature] The temperature for Rome is from [visualcrossing Website](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-history/Roma,%20Lazio,%20Italia/us/2025-01-01/2025-07-31/)
Discription: It shows the temperature data for Rome for the entire year of 2025.
2. [Weather] The [rainfall in Rome](https://meteostat.net/en/place/it/rome?s=16235&t=2025-01-01/2025-07-01&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
Discription: The dataset contains the precipitation data for Rome in 2025.
3. [Temperature] The temperature for Chicago is from [NCDC Web page](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/locations/CITY:US170006/detail).
Discription: Here is the temperature data for Chicago for the entire year of 2025. These two cities have the same latitude, so the temperature can be used to conpared with Rome's.
4. [Weather] The [rainfall in Chicago](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/past-weather/chicago)
Discription: This dataset includes the information on whether it rained and the amount of precipitation.
### Project Idea: I would like to compare the temperature and prcp difference between the cities which locate at same latitude.
5. [Covid-19]：（https://www.datalumos.org/datalumos/project/238956/version/V1/view?path=/datalumos/238956/fcr:versions/V1/DataDictionary_v37_05052023.xlsx&type=file）
Description: This dataset provides the detailed statistic on COVID-19 vaccinations in each US state after May 10, 2023
### Project Idea: Compare the relationship between vaccination numbers and death counts across different states.
